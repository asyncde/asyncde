The main algorithm &ndash; Asynchronous differential evolution with adaptive correlation matrix (ADE-ACM) &ndash; performs derivative-free optimization of multidimensional real-valued functions.
The algorithm has a simple structure and doesn't require tuning of its internal parameters by users. While performing the optimization, ADE-ACM self-adapts crossover rate and scale factor, and inflates the population size if needed.
The AsyncDE library also implements classic DE, JADE and jDE algorithms.

### Usage
AsyncDE requires C++11 compatible compiler (e.g. gcc or clang with development options) and CMake to compile. In addition, the library implements optional MPI and OMP variants for parallel calls of an optimized function within the Master/Workers scheme.
